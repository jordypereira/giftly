This was a school project where the goal was to invent a disruptive application.
Giftly is a platform where you can buy a random box as a gift. You can alter the box with your preferences or keep it completely random.
We worked out the front end in Vue and instead of making a back-end we made every request with the Vuex store.

## Features
- Shopping Cart: Choose a box and it gets saved in the cart.
- Lots of Vuex features, such as deleting a single object and calculating the earliest delivery date based on the packages ordered.

## Tech Stack

- Vue
- Bootstrap
- Vuex
- SCSS
- Animations, sliders, carousels
